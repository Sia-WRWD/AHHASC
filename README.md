<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>
  The application that is built and would be documented is called the APU Hostel Home Appliances Service Centre or in short, “AHHASC” as shown in Figure 1 below. The main
  purpose of the creation of AHHASC is to help the manager and technician to be able to settle the managing of AHHASC’s user’s data, client’s data, and appointment’s 
  data more effectively and efficiently. The AHHASC has two main user roles which are the Manager and Technician. As the clients or customers of AHHASC as per requested 
  would only be able to book an appointment through the manager, the clients will merely act as a data instead of a functioning user as they don’t possess any functionalities. 
  AHHASC has two main functionalities which are the “User Management System” (which is consisted of creating, reading, or displaying, updating, and deleting both technician 
  and manager roles’ users) and “Appointment Management System” (which is consisted of creating, reading, or displaying, updating, and deleting appointment data, 
  payment data and feedback data). Other functionalities include ability to read and update their account details, resetting their account’s password when logged in and a 
  forgot password feature if the users forgot their password during login.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  In Conclusion, it was a fun project to be attempted by my teammate, @conquererFY and I. We both managed to complete the project within 1 month for both the coding of the 
  front-end and back-end of the application. The only process that took a long time would be debugging as there are some hidden bugs which are fixed after numerous testings.
  In addition to that, we are happy to be able to complete the project within such a short period of time as it is a testament of our teamwork, good planning and also understanding
  of the language Java and the OOP Concepts involved.

<h2>Please Pay Attention</h2>
<p>
  Just in the event that the application can't run due to "com." issue.

  Please put the itextpdf-5.4.0.jar into the AHHASC --> dist --> lib folder.

  Though, if there's no such issue, please continue using the application as it is.

  Thank you.
